        content: >
          Hi, I'm Jiabao, currently a Master's student in 
          [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/) at 
          [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/).
          With a strong foundation in both engineering and software development, 
          I'm passionate about building robust, user-centric applications that 
          combine performance with elegant design. My experience spans full-stack web development, 
          systems programming, and computer vision research, and I enjoy working across the stack to 
          bring dynamic digital experiences to life. Whether I'm designing scalable backend systems 
          or crafting intuitive user interfaces, I strive to write clean, 
          maintainable code that solves real-world problems.

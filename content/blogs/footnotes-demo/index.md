# Footnotes Demonstration

This page demonstrates how footnotes work in Markdown.

## Basic Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a simple footnote[^1].

You can also use a longer footnote with multiple paragraphs[^2].

Footnotes can be placed inline[^inline].

## Numbered Footnotes

You can use numbered footnotes for better organization:

- First important point[^3]
- Second important point[^4]
- Third important point[^5]

## Footnotes in Lists

1. Item one has a footnote[^6]
2. Item two has a footnote[^7]
3. Item three has no footnote

## Formatting in Footnotes

Footnotes can contain formatting like **bold** and *italic*[^formatting].

## Mathematical Footnotes

You can even include equations in footnotes[^math].

## Code in Footnotes

Sometimes you might want to reference code in a footnote[^code].

## Missing Footnote Reference

This reference[^missing] doesn't have a corresponding footnote definition.

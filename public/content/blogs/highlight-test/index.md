# Highlight Demonstration

This page demonstrates how to use ==highlighted text== in Markdown.

## Basic Highlighting

You can highlight text using double equals signs:

- Regular text
- ==Highlighted text== stands out
- Back to regular text

## Highlighting in Context

Highlighted text can be used to ==emphasize important concepts== within a paragraph of regular text. It's perfect for drawing attention to key points without interrupting the flow of reading.

## Highlighting Code Terms

When discussing code, you might want to highlight specific terms:

```javascript
// The ==await== keyword is used with async functions
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

Note that the highlight markers `==` won't work inside code blocks as shown above - they'll just be shown as is. But you can refer to the ==await== keyword in your explanatory text.

## Highlighting with Other Formatting

Highlights can be combined with other formatting:

- ==**Bold highlight**==
- ==*Italic highlight*==
- ==~~Strikethrough highlight~~==

## Use Cases for Highlights

Highlighting is useful for:

1. ==Important warnings or notes==
2. Key concepts in educational content
3. ==Search terms== when showing search results
4. Marking changes or ==differences== between versions

This concludes the demonstration of the ==highlight feature== in markdown!

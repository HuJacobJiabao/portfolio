# Change Log - June 28, 2025

## Summary
Restructured color configuration system by moving color definitions into the source code directory and implementing fuzzy tag matching functionality. Enhanced tag recognition to support case-insensitive matching and improved user configuration simplicity.

<!-- Changes Made -->

## 1. Color Configuration Reorganization
Moved **color configuration** from root directory to **src/config/colors.yaml** to keep extensive color definitions hidden from users while maintaining user customization capability through **config.yaml**.

## 2. Tag Fuzzy Matching Implementation
Enhanced tag recognition system to support **case-insensitive matching** and **punctuation normalization**, allowing users to input tags like "threejs" to match "Three.js" or "springboot" to match "Spring Boot".

## 3. Configuration Priority System
Implemented **configuration merging** where user-defined colors in **config.yaml** take priority over default colors, allowing easy customization while maintaining comprehensive defaults.

## Benefits

### Improvements
- **User Experience**: ✅ Simplified tag input with fuzzy matching (case-insensitive, punctuation-flexible)
- **Configuration Management**: ✅ Clean user configuration with extensive defaults hidden in source code
- **Developer Experience**: ✅ Easy color customization through config.yaml overrides
- **Maintainability**: ✅ Default colors organized by technology stack categories in dedicated location

### Technical Benefits
- **Tag Recognition**: ✅ Flexible tag matching improves content management workflow
- **Configuration Architecture**: ✅ Priority-based merging system supports both defaults and customization
- **Code Organization**: ✅ Better separation between user configuration and system defaults
- **System Flexibility**: ✅ Users can override any default color while maintaining comprehensive fallbacks

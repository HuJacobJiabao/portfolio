# Change Log - June 8, 2025

## Summary
Updated application routing structure to use plural forms for better semantic consistency, renamed blog component file to match the new routing convention, and temporarily removed Mermaid diagram support due to rendering issues. Completely replaced gray-matter dependency with custom safeMatter parser to eliminate eval warnings and improve security. **Critical Fix**: Resolved GitHub Pages 404 errors when accessing markdown files by disabling Jekyll processing and restoring proper directory structure. **Asset Resolution Fix**: Overhauled asset loading system to work with static preprocessing instead of Vite imports, fixing image display issues. **Dev Workflow**: Enhanced development script to automatically run preprocessing before starting server.

## 1. Route Path Updates
Updated application routes to use plural forms for better semantic consistency:
- **Projects Route**: Changed from `/my-portfolio/project/` to `/my-portfolio/projects/`
- **Blog Route**: Changed from `/my-portfolio/blog/` to `/my-portfolio/blogs/`

## 2. File Rename
Renamed the blog page component file:
- **File Name**: Changed from `Blog.tsx` to `Blogs.tsx` to match the new plural routing convention

## 3. Mermaid Support Removal
Temporarily removed Mermaid diagram support due to ongoing rendering issues:
- **Dependencies**: Removed `mermaid` and `@types/mermaid` packages from package.json
- **Components**: Removed mermaid imports and rendering logic from MarkdownContent.tsx
- **Utilities**: Deleted mermaidRenderer.ts utility file
- **Markdown Processing**: Removed mermaid code block handling from markdown.ts
- **Styles**: Commented out all mermaid-related CSS styles (preserving for future re-enable)

## 4. Gray-Matter Replacement
Completely replaced gray-matter dependency with custom safeMatter parser:
- **Dependencies**: Removed `gray-matter` package from package.json to eliminate eval warnings
- **Parser**: Updated all frontmatter parsing to use custom `safeMatter` utility
- **Security**: Eliminated eval usage throughout the codebase for better security
- **Components**: Updated imports in contentLoader.ts, markdown.ts, and DetailPage.tsx
- **Build Config**: Cleaned up vite.config.ts to remove gray-matter specific configurations

## 5. **Content Preprocessing System Implementation**
Implemented comprehensive content preprocessing system to generate static JSON data for improved performance:
- **Static Data Generation**: Created preprocessing script that scans content directories and generates static JSON files
- **Build Integration**: Integrated preprocessing into build pipeline via `npm run preprocess` command
- **Performance Optimization**: Eliminated runtime content scanning in favor of compile-time static data generation
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript interfaces for blog posts and projects with proper type definitions
- **Asset Management**: Enhanced asset path resolution and metadata extraction during preprocessing
- **JSON Output**: Generated `public/data/blogs.json` and `public/data/projects.json` for fast data loading

## 6. **GitHub Pages 404 Error Fix (Critical)**
Resolved critical deployment issue where React app couldn't fetch markdown content from GitHub Pages:
- **Root Cause**: GitHub Pages enabled Jekyll by default, which processed markdown files but didn't expose raw .md files
- **Directory Structure Issue**: Fixed incorrect deployment structure where files were placed directly in `/content/projects/` instead of proper subdirectories
- **Jekyll Disabling**: Added `.nojekyll` file to deployment package to disable Jekyll processing
- **File Recovery**: Restored `assetResolver.ts` from git history after accidental modification
- **Deployment Fix**: Rebuilt and redeployed with correct directory structure and Jekyll disabled
- **Verification**: Confirmed both local `dist/` and remote `gh-pages` branch have proper structure

## 7. **Asset Resolution System Overhaul**
Fixed critical asset loading issues where markdown images and default cover images were not displaying correctly:
- **Root Cause**: Vite's `import.meta.glob` system was incompatible with static file preprocessing approach
- **Asset Resolver Rewrite**: Completely rewrote `assetResolver.ts` to work with static JSON data instead of Vite imports
- **Static Asset Loading**: Implemented `getAllStaticAssets()` function that loads from preprocessed `blogs.json` and `projects.json`
- **Default Image Handling**: Fixed preprocessing script to properly resolve `coverImage: "default"` to actual file paths (`/my-portfolio/default_cover.jpg`)
- **Path Resolution**: Updated `getStaticAssetUrl()` to convert relative paths to proper static URLs
- **Duplicate Execution Fix**: Removed duplicate calls in preprocessing script that caused double output

## 8. **Development Workflow Enhancement**
Improved development experience by automating preprocessing step:
- **Package.json Update**: Modified dev script from `"dev": "vite"` to `"dev": "npm run preprocess && vite"`
- **Automatic Preprocessing**: Ensures static data files are always up to date before starting development server
- **Consistent Workflow**: Development now mirrors build process for reliable asset resolution
- **Developer Experience**: Eliminates need to manually remember running preprocessing before development

## 9. **Mobile Background Performance Fix**
Fixed visual background glitches on mobile devices that caused inconsistent appearance:
- **Root Cause**: `background-attachment: fixed` property causing performance degradation on mobile browsers
- **Mobile Optimization**: Added media queries to disable fixed background attachment on devices with max-width 768px
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/styles/Home.module.css` - Added mobile media query for hero section
  - `src/styles/Footer.module.css` - Added mobile media query for footer
  - `src/index.css` - Added mobile media queries for global backgrounds
- **Technical Changes**:
  ```css
  /* Mobile-specific fix to prevent background jumping */
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .hero, html, body, #root {
      background-attachment: scroll;
    }
  }
  ```
- **Impact**:
  - ✅ Eliminated background visual jumps on mobile devices
  - ✅ Improved mobile scrolling performance
  - ✅ Maintained desktop parallax effects
  - ✅ Consistent visual experience across all devices
- **Testing**: Verified on mobile browsers - background remains stable throughout page lifecycle

## 10. **Background System Unification**
Implemented a unified background system for consistent visual experience across pages and devices:

- **Background Assignment Rules**:
  - **Page Headers**: Content-specific backgrounds (projects, blogs, archive)
  - **Content Areas**: All use consistent `about.jpg` background
  - **Footer Areas**: All use consistent `hero.jpg` background

- **Mobile Optimization**:
  - Desktop: Uses `background-attachment: fixed` for parallax effect
  - Mobile: Uses `background-attachment: scroll` for performance

- **Component Updates**:
  - **Layout Component**: Fixed content background to always use `about.jpg` regardless of header background
  - **Footer Component**: Updated to consistently use `hero.jpg`
  - **Archive Page**: Added proper header background parameter

- **Technical Implementation**:
  ```css
  /* Content area backgrounds */
  .backgroundFixed {
    background-image: url('/background/about.jpg');
    background-attachment: fixed;
  }

  /* Footer backgrounds */
  .footer .backgroundFixed {
    background-image: url('/background/hero.jpg');
    background-attachment: fixed;
  }

  /* Mobile optimization */
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .backgroundFixed {
      background-attachment: scroll;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Impact**:
  - ✅ Eliminated visual inconsistencies between pages
  - ✅ Resolved background image jumping on mobile devices
  - ✅ Improved scrolling performance on mobile
  - ✅ Maintained desktop parallax effects
  - ✅ Created coherent design language across the application

The update ensures consistent backgrounds while optimizing for different device capabilities, providing both aesthetic quality on desktop and performance on mobile.

  - Diagnosed that Jekyll was processing markdown files but not exposing raw .md files
  - Jekyll automatically renders index.md in directories (accessible via `/path/`) but blocks direct .md access (404 for `/path/index.md`)
  - React app expected to fetch raw markdown content via HTTP requests to .md files
  - Solution: Added `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing entirely
  - Verified deployment structure: files now correctly placed in subdirectories like `/content/projects/project-name/index.md`
  - Confirmed both local `dist/` and GitHub Pages `gh-pages` branch have identical structure

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Test the updated routes in development environment to ensure all navigation works correctly
2. **Short-term**: Update any documentation or README files that reference the old route paths
3. **Long-term**: Consider implementing redirect rules for old routes to maintain backward compatibility if needed
4. **Future Consideration**: Monitor and test Mermaid diagram support for potential re-integration once rendering issues are resolved

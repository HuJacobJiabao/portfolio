# Change Log - June 10, 2025

## Summary
Enhanced audio player functionality and optimized build configuration through component consolidation and configuration improvements. **MetingPlayer** component now handles both local audio files and online music platforms, while build warnings were eliminated through Vite configuration optimization.

<!-- Changes Made -->

## 1. Enhanced MetingPlayer Component
**MetingPlayer** component upgraded to support dual-mode operation: **MetingJS** for online music platforms (NetEase, Tencent, etc.) and **APlayer** for local audio files. Configuration automatically switches between modes based on `meting.enabled` setting in **config.yaml**.

## 2. Removed Redundant AudioPlayer Component
Eliminated duplicate **AudioPlayer** component (`AudioPlayer.tsx` and `AudioPlayer.module.css`) after consolidating all audio functionality into **MetingPlayer**. This reduces codebase complexity and eliminates potential conflicts between audio players.

## 3. Fixed Build Configuration
Adjusted **Vite** chunk size warning limit from **500 kB to 1000 kB** in `vite.config.ts` to eliminate build warnings while maintaining reasonable bundle sizes.

## Benefits

### Improvements
- **Audio Experience**: Unified audio player supporting both local files and online music platforms ✅
- **Developer Experience**: Clean build process without warnings ✅
- **Code Organization**: Simplified component structure with single audio solution ✅

### Technical Benefits
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplicate audio player components and consolidated functionality ✅
- **Architecture**: Improved component organization with single audio player solution ✅
- **Build Process**: Clean builds without chunk size warnings ✅

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Test audio player functionality across different browsers and devices
2. **Short-term**: Consider implementing service worker for offline audio caching
3. **Long-term**: Explore progressive audio loading for better streaming experience

## Implementation Summary

### Problem Statement
Completed the extraction and packaging of the personal portfolio codebase into a reusable **🍙 OnigiriPress** framework, while also addressing critical infrastructure issues with markdown static asset path resolution and GitHub Actions deployment failures.

### Solution Overview
Successfully created and published the **🍙 OnigiriPress** portfolio framework as an npm package, refactored the markdown asset path resolution system to use consistent public-based paths, and fixed the GitHub Actions workflow for reliable automated deployments.

<!--Technical Implementations -->

## 1. 🍙 OnigiriPress Framework Creation and NPM Publication

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: The personal portfolio codebase had grown into a robust, reusable framework suitable for other developers but was tied to personal content
- **Root Cause**: Lack of separation between framework functionality and personal portfolio content
- **Impact**: Valuable portfolio framework was not available for the broader developer community

### Solution Design
- **Approach**: Extract core framework functionality into a standalone, configurable package while maintaining all existing features
- **Architecture**: Modular React + TypeScript + Vite framework with YAML-based configuration system
- **Alternatives Considered**: Template repository approach, different package managers, monorepo structure



### Package Structure
```

├── bin/                    # CLI tools
├── src/                    # Framework source code
│   ├── components/         # Reusable React components
│   ├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
│   ├── pages/             # Core page components

├── docs/                  # Documentation
└── package.json           # NPM package configuration
```

### Files Modified
- **package.json**: Configured as public npm package with CLI tools and proper metadata
- **bin/onigiri-press.js**: Created CLI tool for project initialization
- **src/config/**: Abstracted configuration system with YAML support
- **templates/**: Created template files for new projects
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation for framework usage
- **.npmignore**: Configured package distribution files

### NPM Publication Details
- **Package Name**: `onigiri-press`
- **Version**: `1.1.16`
- **Registry**: Published to npm public registry
- **Features**: CLI tool, TypeScript definitions, comprehensive documentation
- **Installation**: `npm install -g onigiri-press` or `npx onigiri-press <project-name>`

### Testing Results
- ✅ Successfully published to npm registry
- ✅ CLI tool creates new projects correctly
- ✅ Framework maintains all original functionality
- ✅ Configuration system works across different project setups
- ✅ Documentation and examples are comprehensive
- ✅ Package installation and usage tested across multiple environments

## 2. Markdown Static Asset Resolution Refactor

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: Static assets (images, files) referenced in markdown content were not resolving correctly in production builds
- **Root Cause**: Asset paths were being resolved relative to markdown file locations rather than the public directory structure
- **Impact**: Broken images and links in blog posts and project documentation, affecting user experience

### Solution Design
- **Approach**: Standardize all asset paths to use public-based resolution with consistent base paths
- **Architecture**: Centralized asset path resolution through the markdown processing pipeline
- **Alternatives Considered**: Relative path resolution, CDN-based assets, build-time asset copying

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Updated markdown asset path resolution to use public-based paths
const resolveAssetPath = (path: string): string => {
  // Ensure all assets resolve to public directory structure
  if (path.startsWith('/')) {
    return path; // Already absolute from public root
  }
  return `/assets/${path}`; // Normalize relative paths
};

// Modified markdown processor to handle asset resolution consistently
export const processMarkdownAssets = (content: string): string => {
  return content.replace(
    /!\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g,
    (match, alt, src) => {
      const resolvedSrc = resolveAssetPath(src);
      return `![${alt}](${resolvedSrc})`;
    }
  );
};
```

### Files Modified
- `src/components/MarkdownContent.tsx` - Updated asset path resolution logic
- `src/utils/markdown-processor.ts` - Centralized path resolution functions
- `vite.config.ts` - Configured public directory handling for static assets

### Testing Results
- ✅ All markdown images now display correctly in production
- ✅ Asset paths resolve consistently across all deployment environments
- ✅ Build process handles static assets without errors
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility maintained

## 3. GitHub Actions Deployment Fix

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: GitHub Actions deployment workflow was failing during artifact extraction and deployment steps
- **Root Cause**: Outdated artifact handling and incorrect build output configuration
- **Impact**: Automated deployments were broken, requiring manual deployment processes

### Solution Design
- **Approach**: Update GitHub Actions workflow with proper artifact extraction and modern action versions
- **Architecture**: Streamlined CI/CD pipeline with reliable artifact handling
- **Alternatives Considered**: Alternative deployment platforms, different artifact storage methods

### Implementation Details
```yaml
# Updated GitHub Actions workflow for proper deployment
- name: Build project
  run: |
    npm ci
    npm run build

- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-files
    path: dist/

- name: Download build artifacts
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-files
    path: dist/

- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./dist
```

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Fixed artifact extraction and deployment configuration
- `package.json` - Updated build scripts for proper CI/CD integration

### Testing Results
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully
- ✅ Artifacts are properly extracted and deployed
- ✅ Automated deployment to GitHub Pages working
- ✅ Build process optimized for CI/CD environment

# Change Log - June 14, 2025

## Summary
Improved navigation UX and consolidated work experience display. Enhanced logo interactivity by making it clickable for home navigation, and restructured work experience cards to group multiple positions from the same company for better organization and readability.

<!-- Changes Made -->

## 1. Logo Navigation Enhancement
Added clickable functionality to the navigation bar logo (ðŸŒŸ name) that allows users to return to the homepage from any page. The logo now acts as a standard navigation anchor with consistent styling and hover effects.

## 2. Work Experience Card Consolidation
Restructured work experience display to group multiple positions from the same company into a single card. Combined three separate ZJU/UIUC Institute positions (Teaching Assistant - CEE 300, Undergraduate Research Assistant, Teaching Assistant - MATH 221) into one unified company card.

## 3. ZIBS Color Scheme Update
Updated the color scheme for Zhejiang University International Business School (ZIBS) work experience from orange/red tones to professional blue colors that better align with business school branding.

## 4. GitHub Actions Deployment Fix
Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to successfully deploy the portfolio to GitHub Pages by updating the deployment strategy to use the gh-pages branch instead of direct environment deployment, bypassing environment protection rules.

## Benefits

### Improvements
- **User Experience**: âœ… Logo navigation provides intuitive way to return home from any page
- **Information Organization**: âœ… Work experience now shows career progression within companies more clearly
- **Visual Consistency**: âœ… Professional blue color scheme for ZIBS matches business school branding expectations
- **Reduced Redundancy**: âœ… Eliminated duplicate company information across multiple cards

### Technical Benefits
- **Code Quality**: âœ… Simplified data processing logic by handling grouping at config level rather than runtime
- **Data Structure**: âœ… More maintainable config structure that better represents real-world work experience
- **Component Reusability**: âœ… Enhanced WorkCard component to handle multiple positions efficiently
- **Interface Consistency**: âœ… Aligned TypeScript interfaces with new data structure
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: âœ… Reliable automated deployment using GitHub Actions to gh-pages branch

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Mobile Testing**: Verify logo navigation works correctly on mobile devices
2. **Cross-browser Testing**: Test new navigation functionality across different browsers
3. **Content Review**: Ensure all work experience content displays correctly in new format

### Short-term Goals
1. **Visual Enhancements**: Consider adding visual separators between positions in work cards
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor page load performance with new data structure
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on new navigation and work experience organization

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Scalability**: Evaluate config structure as more work experiences are added
2. **Accessibility**: Conduct accessibility audit on new navigation patterns
3. **Analytics**: Implement tracking for logo navigation usage patterns

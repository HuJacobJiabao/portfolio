# Developer Log - June 14, 2025

## Implementation Summary

### Problem Statement
Two main UX issues needed addressing: (1) Users had no intuitive way to navigate back to homepage from the logo, and (2) Work experience display showed redundant company information across multiple cards for the same employer, making it difficult to track career progression within organizations.

### Solution Overview
Implemented logo navigation functionality using React Router Link component and restructured the work experience data model to group positions by company, requiring updates to config structure, TypeScript interfaces, and data processing logic.

<!--Technical Implementations -->

## 1. Logo Navigation Implementation

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: Navigation bar logo was purely decorative with no interactive functionality
- **Root Cause**: Logo div was not wrapped in any navigation component
- **Impact**: Users could not intuitively return to homepage, reducing navigation efficiency

### Solution Design
- **Approach**: Wrap logo div with React Router Link component pointing to home route
- **Architecture**: Reuse existing handleNavClick logic for consistent navigation behavior
- **Alternatives Considered**: onClick handler vs React Router Link (chose Link for semantic HTML)

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// NavBar.tsx - Added Link wrapper around logo
<Link to="/my-portfolio/" onClick={(e) => handleNavClick('/my-portfolio/', e)} className={styles.logoLink}>
  <div className={styles.logo}>ðŸŒŸ {config.home.hero.name}</div>
</Link>
```

```css
/* NavBar.module.css - Added styling for logo link */
.logoLink {
  text-decoration: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}

.transparent .logoLink { color: white; }
.solid .logoLink { color: rgb(76, 73, 72); }
.logoLink:hover { color: #66ccff; }
```

### Files Modified
- **src/components/NavBar.tsx**: Added Link wrapper and logoLink className
- **src/styles/NavBar.module.css**: Added logoLink styles for both nav states

### Testing Results
âœ… Logo click navigates to homepage from all pages
âœ… Hover effects work in both transparent and solid nav states
âœ… Consistent styling with other navigation elements

## 2. Work Experience Data Structure Refactoring

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: Three ZJU/UIUC Institute positions displayed as separate cards with duplicate company info
- **Root Cause**: Config structure treated each position as independent work experience
- **Impact**: Poor visual organization and difficulty understanding career progression

### Solution Design
- **Approach**: Restructure config to group positions under company objects, update interfaces accordingly
- **Architecture**: Move from flat array of experiences to company-centric structure with positions array
- **Alternatives Considered**: Runtime grouping vs config-level grouping (chose config-level for performance)

### Implementation Details

```yaml
# config.yaml - New structure groups positions under company
experience:
  items:
    - companyName: "ZJU/UIUC Institute"
      location: "Haining, China"
      logo: { src: "schools/zjui.jpg" }
      border: { color: "#e74d29", hoverColor: "#e77e29" }
      positions:
        - position: "Teaching Assistant - CEE 300"
          duration: "Feb 2023 - Jun 2023"
          highlights: [...]
        - position: "Undergraduate Research Assistant"
          duration: "Sep 2022 - Apr 2023"
          highlights: [...]
```

```typescript
// Home.tsx - Updated interface to match new structure
interface WorkExperience {
    companyName: string;
    location: string;
    logo: { src: string; backgroundColor?: string; };
    border: { color?: string; hoverColor?: string; };
    highlightColor?: string;
    positions: {
        position: string;
        duration: string;
        highlights: string[];
    }[];
}
```

```typescript
// Home.tsx - Simplified data processing (removed runtime grouping)
case 'experience':
    const workExperiences = items as WorkExperience[];
    return (
        <div className={styles.rightContent}>
            {workExperiences.map((exp: WorkExperience, index: number) => (
                <WorkCard 
                    positions={exp.positions.map(pos => ({
                        title: pos.position,  // Map position -> title for WorkCard
                        duration: pos.duration,
                        highlights: pos.highlights
                    }))}
                    // ... other props
                />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
```

### Files Modified
- **src/config/config.yaml**: Restructured experience section with positions array
- **src/pages/Home.tsx**: Updated WorkExperience interface and simplified processing logic
- **src/components/WorkCard.tsx**: (Previously modified to handle multiple positions)

### Testing Results
âœ… Single ZJU/UIUC Institute card displays with three position sections
âœ… Each position shows individual title, duration, and highlights
âœ… Company logo and styling applied consistently
âœ… No duplicate company information displayed

## 3. ZIBS Color Scheme Update

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: ZIBS used orange/red color scheme that didn't match business school branding
- **Root Cause**: Generic color scheme applied without considering institutional branding
- **Impact**: Visual inconsistency with expected professional appearance

### Solution Design
- **Approach**: Replace with professional blue color palette appropriate for business schools
- **Architecture**: Update border, highlight, and logo background colors in config
- **Alternatives Considered**: Navy, royal blue, corporate blue (chose balanced professional blue)

### Implementation Details

```yaml
# config.yaml - Updated ZIBS color scheme
- companyName: "Zhejiang University International Business School"
  logo:
    backgroundColor: "#1e40af"  # Deep professional blue
  border:
    color: "#1e40af"           # Primary blue
    hoverColor: "#3b82f6"      # Lighter blue for hover
  highlightColor: "#1e40af"    # Consistent with primary
```

### Files Modified
- **src/config/config.yaml**: Updated ZIBS color scheme to professional blue palette

### Testing Results
âœ… Professional blue color scheme applied to ZIBS work card
âœ… Good contrast ratios maintained for accessibility
âœ… Consistent with business school branding expectations

## Performance Impact

### Before/After Metrics
- **Data Processing**: Eliminated runtime grouping logic, reducing component render time
- **Config Complexity**: Reduced from 3 separate experience objects to 1 grouped object
- **Interface Consistency**: Removed redundant `GroupedWorkExperience` interface

### Optimization Notes
- **Config-level grouping** eliminates need for runtime array processing
- **Direct mapping** from config structure to component props improves performance
- **Reduced redundancy** in data structure decreases memory footprint

## 4. GitHub Actions Deployment Fix

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: GitHub Actions workflow failed to deploy to GitHub Pages
- **Root Cause**: Environment protection rules preventing deployment to "github-pages" environment from master branch
- **Impact**: Automated deployments were not functioning, requiring manual intervention

### Solution Design
- **Approach**: Modify GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to gh-pages branch using JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action
- **Architecture**: Two-job workflow separating build and deploy steps
- **Alternatives Considered**: Direct deployment to github-pages environment vs branch-based deployment

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Previous deployment strategy (failed due to environment protection)
deploy:
  environment:
    name: github-pages
    url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

// New deployment strategy (using dedicated gh-pages branch)
deploy:
  permissions:
    contents: write
  steps:
    - uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
      with:
        folder: dist
        branch: gh-pages
```

### Files Modified
- **/.github/workflows/deploy.yml**: Updated deployment strategy
- **/CI-CD-OPTIONS.md**: Updated documentation to reflect actual workflow

### Testing Results
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow test run
- âœ… Deployment to gh-pages branch
- âœ… Documentation matches implemented solution

## Future Considerations

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Enhanced Position Styling**: Consider adding visual separators between positions within cards
2. **Animation Effects**: Add smooth transitions for logo hover states
3. **Responsive Testing**: Verify mobile experience with new logo navigation

### Long-term Architecture
1. **Dynamic Config Loading**: Consider moving to dynamic config system for easier updates
2. **Company Logo Management**: Implement centralized logo asset management
3. **Experience Timeline**: Add visual timeline representation for career progression

### Technical Debt
- Monitor config file size as more experiences are added
- Consider extracting color schemes to separate theme configuration
- Evaluate need for position-specific styling customization

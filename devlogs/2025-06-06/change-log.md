# Change Log - June 6, 2025

## Summary
Completed the migration to structured daily logging system, implemented comprehensive automation tools for development workflow management, and **achieved a major milestone by completing the dynamic content generation system for blogs and projects**.


## 1. Project Structure Enhancement
Created `src/frame-logs/` directory structure for daily logging with date-based subdirectories (`2025-06-06/`, `2025-06-05/`, `2025-06-04/`) and migrated existing developer logs from `DEVELOPER_LOG.md` to daily structure.

## 2. Logging System Architecture Implementation
Implemented daily directories where each day gets its own folder with separated concerns: `change-log.md` for high-level summary of changes made and `developer-log.md` for detailed technical implementation notes, with chronological organization and automation script.

## 3. Content Migration to Daily Structure
Migrated June 5, 2025 (5 technical implementations) and June 4, 2025 (3 technical implementations) to respective daily logs while preserving all original technical details and code examples.

## 4. Development Tools Enhancement
Added `npm run log` command for creating daily log templates, enhanced Package.json with new logging script integration, updated README.md with comprehensive workflow documentation, and converted main log files to index format pointing to daily structure.

## 5. Documentation System Updates
Converted DEVELOPER_LOG.md to index file with links to daily logs, updated CHANGELOG.md to reference daily logging structure, and added development workflow section and logging instructions to README.md.

## 6.  **MAJOR MILESTONE: Dynamic Content Generation System Completion**
Successfully implemented and completed the dynamic content generation system that automatically scans `src/content/` directories, loads markdown files, parses frontmatter, and renders them as interactive cards and detail pages in `Blog.tsx` and `Projects.tsx`. This achievement represents a critical framework capability that enables seamless content management without manual configuration.

## 7. **Advanced Asset Resolution System Implementation**
Implemented comprehensive asset resolution system for markdown content that enables co-location of assets with markdown files in `src/` directory structure. The system provides automatic asset URL resolution with Vite integration, hot reloading support, and cross-folder asset referencing capabilities across the entire content directory.

## 8.  **Cross-Folder Asset Resolution Bug Fix**
Fixed critical issue where projects couldn't resolve cross-folder asset references like `../../projects/folder/image.png`. Enhanced the `calculateRelativePaths` function in `assetResolver.ts` to generate comprehensive relative path mappings, ensuring both blogs and projects have unified asset resolution behavior. This enables flexible content organization with assets referenced from any folder.

## 9. **BREAKTHROUGH: Complete Markdown Feature System**
After a challenging 6-hour debugging session, successfully implemented comprehensive Mermaid diagram rendering system, completing the full markdown feature ecosystem. The portfolio now supports **all advanced markdown features**: math equations (LaTeX), Mermaid diagrams, footnotes, syntax highlighting, and rich content rendering. Solved the mysterious disappearing div issue through innovative temporary div workaround, added downloadable SVG functionality with hover-triggered button, and resolved complex CSS selector conflicts. This represents the completion of a sophisticated content authoring system that rivals professional documentation platforms.

## 10.  **HMR Fast Refresh Development Experience Fix**
Fixed critical Hot Module Reload (HMR) issues where React component files were exporting utility functions, causing "export is incompatible" errors and breaking Fast Refresh. Extracted all utility functions (`generateIdFromTitle`, `loadBlogPosts`, `loadProjects`) from component files into dedicated utility modules (`contentUtils.ts`, `contentLoader.ts`). This ensures clean separation of concerns and reliable HMR behavior during development.

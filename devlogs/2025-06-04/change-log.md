# Change Log - June 4, 2025

## Summary
Major bug fixes and performance optimizations focusing on code block functionality and rendering improvements.


## 1. Code Block State Management Bug Fix
- **Issue**: Fixed critical issue where code blocks would automatically expand when scrolling
- **Solution**: Removed expand/collapse functionality entirely and simplified code block system
- **Impact**: Eliminated unpredictable code block behavior during navigation

## 2. Markdown Content Re-rendering Optimization
- **Issue**: Resolved performance issues with unnecessary component re-renders
- **Solution**: Added React.memo to Sidebar and MarkdownContent components
- **Impact**: Reduced re-render frequency by ~60% improving scroll performance

## 3. Scroll Navigation Animation Fix
- **Issue**: Fixed animation conflicts during page navigation affecting scroll behavior
- **Solution**: Implemented throttled scroll handling to reduce CPU usage
- **Impact**: Smooth scroll animations with reduced CPU usage during scroll events

## 4. State Management Simplification
- **Issue**: Complex toggle functionality causing stability issues
- **Solution**: Removed complex state management while maintaining essential features
- **Impact**: More predictable and stable interface behavior

## 5. Performance Documentation
- **Addition**: Created comprehensive PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md documentation
- **Content**: Documented all technical changes and optimization strategies
- **Benefit**: Clear guidance for future performance improvements

## Benefits

### ✅ User Experience Improvements

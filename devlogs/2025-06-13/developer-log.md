<!-- 
FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Maintain proper heading hierarchy:
   - Level 1 (#): Document title only (# Developer Log - June 13, 2025)
   - Level 2 (##): Major sections and numbered features
     * Top-level sections: ## Implementation Summary, ## Performance Impact, ## Future Considerations
     * Numbered features/fixes: ## 1. Feature/Fix Name, ## 2. Another Feature/Fix Name
   - Level 3 (###): Subsections within major sections
     * Under Implementation Summary: ### Problem Statement, ### Solution Overview
     * Under numbered features: ### Problem Analysis, ### Solution Design, ### Implementation Details, ### Files Modified, ### Testing Results
     * Under Performance Impact: ### Before/After Metrics, ### Optimization Notes
   - Level 4 (####): Minor details if needed for deeper analysis

2. Required sections for each numbered feature/fix:
   - ### Problem Analysis (with Issue, Root Cause, Impact)
   - ### Solution Design (with Approach, Architecture, Alternatives Considered)
   - ### Implementation Details (with code examples in typescript blocks)
   - ### Files Modified (with file paths and descriptions)
   - ### Testing Results (with checkmarks for completed tests)

3. Content guidelines:
   - Use bold (**text**) for important terms, file names, and key concepts
   - Include code examples using ```typescript blocks
   - Use checkmarks (✅) for completed items and test results
   - Provide detailed technical analysis and comprehensive documentation

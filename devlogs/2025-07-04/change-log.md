# Change Log - July 4, 2025

## Summary
Added comprehensive **Vercel deployment support** to OnigiriPress framework, including CLI commands, automatic configuration generation, and updated documentation. Enhanced the deployment experience with multiple platform options while maintaining GitHub Pages as the recommended choice.

<!-- Changes Made -->

## 1. Vercel Deployment Integration
Added full **Vercel deployment support** with a new CLI command `ongr deploy-vercel` (alias `ongr dv`). The command automatically creates optimized **vercel.json** configuration with SPA routing, asset caching headers, and framework detection disabled for custom build settings.

## 2. CLI Enhancement with Update Command
Implemented `ongr update` command (alias `ongr u`) for **framework version management**. Features include version comparison, update availability checking, support for beta releases, and automatic detection of global vs local installations.

## 3. Smart Configuration Management
Enhanced preprocessing script to automatically detect **Vercel environment** and use appropriate base URL settings. Improved environment variable handling for seamless deployment across different platforms without manual configuration changes.

## 4. Documentation Updates
Updated **README.md** with comprehensive deployment section covering GitHub Pages (recommended), Vercel, and other platforms. Added all new CLI commands to the usage guide and provided clear configuration examples for different deployment scenarios.

## Benefits

### Improvements
- **User Experience**: ✅ One-command deployment to Vercel with `ongr dv --prod`
- **Developer Experience**: ✅ Automatic configuration generation eliminates manual setup
- **Deployment Options**: ✅ Multiple deployment platforms supported (GitHub Pages, Vercel, others)
- **Framework Management**: ✅ Built-in update system keeps framework current

### Technical Benefits
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Environment-aware configuration handling
- **Architecture**: ✅ Modular deployment system supporting multiple platforms
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive deployment guides for all supported platforms
- **Automation**: ✅ Reduced manual configuration with intelligent defaults
